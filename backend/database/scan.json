      "fileContent": "ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and complex web applications due to its efficient rendering and component-based architecture. React allows developers to build reusable UI components, making development faster and more scalable. One of its key features is the virtual DOM, which optimizes performance by updating only the necessary parts of the user interface instead of reloading the entire page. React also supports state management, making it easy to handle data and user interactions. With its strong ecosystem, including tools like React Router and Redux, ReactJS continues to be a preferred choice for modern web development.",
