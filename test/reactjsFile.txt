React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance by updating only the necessary parts of the real DOM. It follows a declarative approach, making code more predictable and easier to debug. React also supports hooks, enabling state management without class components. With a vast ecosystem, including libraries like React Router and Redux, React.js is widely used for modern web development, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
